                <p>
                What happens in the sketches is a result of the university
                biting the bullet and spending some money on building parking areas.
                There is a professor who was able to find parking
                and get to teach his class on time. There is also a student
                who was able to get to class on time because she was able to 
                find an empty parking spot. Lastly is a university administrator 
                who is furious with how much the extra parking cost to the university.

            The diagram shown offers 20 different ideas sectioned into 5 different categories
            showing how the solution of more parking availability can be attained.

            The app allows students and faculty members of the University of South Carolina 
            to reserve a parking spot in a desired parking garage or parking 
            lot. Once the space has been reserved, the app will provide directions 
            to the designated parking spot. Students and faculty will be required to 
            scan their Carolina Card to enter the respective garages and lots.
