                What happens in the sketches is a result of the university
                biting the bullet and spending some money on building parking areas.
                There is a professor who was able to find parking
                and get to teach his class on time. There is also a student
                who was able to get to class on time because she was able to 
                find an empty parking spot. Lastly is a university administrator 
                who is furious with how much the extra parking cost to the university.
